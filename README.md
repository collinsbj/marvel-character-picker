# Marvel Character Picker

#### The Bottom Line
The Marvel Character Picker (MCP) utilizes the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) to allow you, dear user, to select your favorites from all 1,491 of Marvel's comic universe characters.

#### All Characters List
In the All Characters List, you'll see a picture of every character and a star that allows you to add that character to your favorites list.  If you click on the character a modal will pop open to show their description as well as every comic that that character appears in.  If you hover over a comic it will give you a thumbnail of the cover of that comic and if you click the list icon on the right that comic will be added to your reading list.

#### Favorites List
On your Favorites List, you will see every character that you've selected as a favorite with the ability to see more info about them just as you can in the All Characters List.  In addition, you can give each of the characters a ranking.  You can also sort your favorite characters by Rank, Name, and Appearances.

#### Reading List
On the Reading List screen, you'll see every comic that was added to your reading list along with an image of the cover.  Clicking on the card will open a modal that gives you a description of the comic, the page count, and every character that appears in it, along with the ability to add those characters to your favorites list.
